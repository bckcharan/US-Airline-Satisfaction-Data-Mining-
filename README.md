# US-Airline-Satisfaction-Data-Mining-
Kaggle Prediction Challenge

Introduction
------------
In the aviation industry, high-grade customer satisfaction is a key factor to run the business, as the airline industry is very competitive and customer loyalty varies with small changes in the services. Therefore, companies need to understand the customers’ need to deliver unparalleled experiences to retain customers. 
Using the customer’s satisfaction data obtained from Kaggle, we here attempt to understand the reasons for customer experience being satisfied or not. Based on that, improvements will be made to provide better service by the airline company. Also, as part of the analysis, we will be able to understand several factors which improve customer satisfaction level.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
In our scenario, the airline company wants to identify a customer satisfaction level, based on his rating on various aspects of airline experience. Hence, primarily we build a model to classify the customer satisfaction level. Precisely we will classify customers’ being satisfied or not and accordingly try to find out the factors related to high satisfaction.

CONCLUSION
----------
We conclude that decision tree model we built using the CART algorithm, is statistically better suitable for our dataset and business model providing us with an accuracy of 87 percent along with 88 percent correctly identifying “satisfied” customers (Sensitivity) and 85 percent correctly identifying “neutral or dissatisfied” customers (Specificity).
Also, we observed from exploratory analysis and decision tree as well, the Inflight experience and Seat Comfort level and Online service level significantly affect the customer experience along with several other variables considered.  The airline service companies must ensure high quality of service in these parameters to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction.
